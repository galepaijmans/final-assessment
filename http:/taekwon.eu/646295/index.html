                    There is also a large indoor shopping center in the middle of the neighborhood with more than 125 stores, including Albert Heijn, Blokker, DekaMarkt, HEMA, etc. This shopping mall was designed as a car-free and above all pleasant pedestrian area was uncovered. However, it was renovated thoroughly with the passages covered. To achieve an urban atmosphere, the project goal is diversity of spaces as it was in the historic city center of Haarlem, “Squares, streets and alleyways where low wide and high narrow street profiles alternate.” The plan also includes a few higher elements with both offices and homes. On 5 September 2019, AM, the developer, started  to expand the shopping center around California Square. This part will consist of both Albert Heijn and Aldi on the ground floor, a parking garage, more than hundred of private sector homes and around 40 care homes. The new cinema “Kinepolis” will also be built in the next phase. However, after the renovation, the area will continue under the name “Schalkwijk Center.”

                    Nevertheless, there are two develop zones in Schalkwijk, The Europaweg and Schipholweg. These develop zones are needed the necessary homes. Plus, to adding houses, some facilities are going to be added and the public space is also taken in hand. Adding homes in these zones contributes a greater diversity in housing stock of Schalkwijk. The development takes account in required space for schools, sports and care facilities. Additionally, the city streets will offer residents cyclists, pedestrians, public transport, and a lively connection between Schalkwijk and the center.
